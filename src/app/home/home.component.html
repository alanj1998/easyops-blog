    <h1>Welcome to EasyOps Blog!</h1>
    <hr/>
    <br/>
    <p>The purpose of this blog is to track my progress through PRJ400 for the year 2019-2020.</p>
    <p>The project I am taking on board is a multi-cloud deployment platform, which allows easy use of a natural language DSL in order to effectively and easily deploy all resources to the cloud</p>
    <p>Cloud hosting and cloud development have been the new buzz words in the computing world since 2015. First came the ability to offload some of the internal infrastructure. It was a revolutionary achievement which allowed to offload local data centers and spread the environment over many countries, then came the concept of virtual networking, serverless functions, managed database instances, the list is endless. And of course as it comes with new innovations, cloud leaders have risen from all other competitors. This gave the cloud infrastructure a lot of competitiveness forcing everyone to find new ways to attract customers. This race to the top ended up with many cloud providers providing the same resources but some that are very distinct and no way to manage it all. For example, why should you be tied to Azure if you decide to host a small managed MongoDB cluster? On AWS, you would need to pay upwards of 200 euro/month in order to host an entire fleet of servers to support that infrastructure. Also what if you feel that AWS Lambda is the superior cloud function provider but you want to use it with Google Kubernetes System? All of this would result in several accounts, credentials, micro-managing in order to run the clusters efficiently and securely. This results in developers backing one cloud provider for a project and just sticking with them forcing a vendor lock-in. This uncertainty gave rise to this project, a project that helps to find a solution to a multi-cloud environment.</p>
    <p>The solution to this problem is EasyOps. EasyOps is a revolutionary product which allows anyone, regardless of their knowledge of networking and DevOps, to develop multi-cloud deployments without much hassle. It makes sure that the data flow is fully protected by locking down infrastructure and only allowing access to resources you explicitly allow. This helps with being compliant to any data protection laws, what all companies now have to abide by. The product consists of four main components: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>EasyOps Core: this is the core of the app which takes care of applying all of the parsed templates into a cloud infrastructure. It takes in the output of the parser, translates it into templates using the template engine and then applies the changes to the cloud. Any changes applied to the cloud are tracked, and a change log is produced for the user before the deployment is done. This allows the user to see all changes and approve them before deploying.</li>
      <li>EasyOps CLI: this is the entry point for most of the tasks done in EasyOps. The easy to use CLI allows the user to view their current deployment, add new resources and update their stacks using a DSL.</li>
      <li>EasyOps Parser and EasyOps DSL: the DSL and the parser are the beauty factor of EasyOps. By using the DSL, anyone is able to quickly assemble their whole deployment environment without much knowledge on DevOps and networking. The parser is able to notify of any issues the user may have and also due to its nature of providing an IaC infrastructure, allow reusable code which describes your environment.</li>
      <li>EasyOps Web App (TBD): The frontend allows ANYONE to deploy their applications without a single configuration. All you need is an app, either hosted in any of the popular version control systems or zipped ready to be uploaded, EasyOps takes care of the rest! It also includes a visual representation of the data flow allowing the user to see if there are places where theyâ€™re missing necessary compliance.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Hopefully this has helped you to gain some interest in the project. Feel free to look around!</p>
